A high-performance, real-time cryptocurrency arbitrage detector built in Go. Monitor multiple exchanges simultaneously to identify profitable trading opportunities where price differences between exchanges create potential for profit.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Exchange Support**: Currently supports Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase with easy extensibility
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: WebSocket connections for live market data
- **Multi-Pair Trading**: Monitor BTC, ETH, SOL, and more against USDT/USD
- **Fee-Aware Calculations**: Accounts for exchange trading fees when calculating potential profits
- **Opportunity Logging**: Records all detected arbitrage opportunities for analysis
- **High Performance**: Written in Go for speed and efficiency
- **Web UI**: Simple dashboard to visualize opportunities (optional)
- **Simulation Mode**: Test the system without real exchange connections

## üìä How It Works

1. **Connect to Exchanges**: Establishes WebSocket connections to supported cryptocurrency exchanges
2. **Market Data Analysis**: Continuously monitors the bid-ask spreads across exchanges
3. **Arbitrage Detection**: Identifies situations where buying on one exchange and selling on another would yield profit
4. **Fee Calculation**: Accounts for trading fees to ensure opportunities are genuinely profitable
5. **Opportunity Logging**: Records profitable arbitrage opportunities with timestamps and profit metrics

## üìã Requirements

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Internet connection for live exchange data
- API credentials for exchanges (optional, simulation mode works without them)
