## What is Arbitrage?

Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of price differences for the same asset in different markets. In the context of cryptocurrency trading, this means buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower and simultaneously selling it on another exchange where the price is higher, making a profit from the price difference.
